Rudder forces basic approximation (non hydrodynamic computation).
Rudder torque-force (lateral) computation result:
F(a, v) = 0.5*r*A*v^2*k^2*sin(a)*cos^2(pi/2 - 2*a)

Rudder resistance-force (longitudinal) computation result:
F(a, v) = 0.5*r*A*v^2*k^2*sin(a)*[1 - sin^2(pi/2 - 2*a)]

a: rudder angle
v: speed over water
r: water density
A: rudder surface area below the water line
k: k = vd/v where vd is the speed of water deflected by the rudder (assuming that vd < v).

This assumes that the force of water stream  moving at speed v through a surface area A is: F = 0.5*r*A*v^2




Submerged Volume:
V(d) = A*d

rw*V(d) = m + ld => rw*A*d = m + ld => d = (m + ld) / (rw*A)

d:  boat draught
m:  boat mass
rw: water density
A:  boat horizontal cross-sectional area (i.e. when viewed vertically from above).




Lateral resistance cofficient estimation:
For total lateral resistance coefficient estimation try:

cdLat = (2*m*omg)/(v*rw*A)
m:  boat mass
rw: water density
A:  boat side incidence area (i.e. when viewed vertically from above).

The omg and v parameters are target boat performance parameters for the turning performance of the
boat at constant speed (i.e. assuming a propulsion force along the boat axis that keeps the boat
speed constant).
omg: constant angular velocity at a fixed boat speed v
v:   constant boat speed v
